590 Neural Networks &amp; Deep Learning Final Project - Random Forrest Team

Project Abstract:

Image recognition has been a key field within computer vision and image processing. Its applications have become increasingly important in our everyday lives, which, in turn, lead to more innovation in the field of image recognition. Our team wanted to take this crucial method and apply it to the Stanford Dog Dataset, described below. To accomplish our goal of building the perfect dog breed classification model, we used both conventional convolutional neural network and transfer learning methods, as well as ensemble models that combined these standalone “handmade” and transfer learning models. We compared each model’s accuracy score to determine the best dog breed classification model.
